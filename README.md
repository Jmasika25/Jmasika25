## Hi there 👋
My name is Judetadeus Masika, I'm a Statistician with experience in the use of statistical packages such as SPSS, STATA, SAS and R-studio. Also as a data analyst, I use programming languages such as Python and R-studio for data manipulation, wrangling and analysis, Power BI for data visualization and presentation. I also use Postgresql for database management. 

- 🔭 A little more about me ...
I started off in Data Analytics — wrangling spreadsheets, writing SQL, and building dashboards in Power BI and Excel. As I explored deeper into Machine Learning, I discovered my love for solving problems with data. Fast-forward to today, I'm:

🧠 Building and deploying models for credit scoring, risk detection, customer intelligence, and HR analytics
🔁 Automating workflows with MLOps tools like MLflow, Docker, and Airflow
🤖 Experimenting with LLMs, Generative AI, and autonomous agents using PyTorch, LangChain, and vector databases
🌍 Collaborating on projects and mentoring 20+ upcoming data scientists and engineers
